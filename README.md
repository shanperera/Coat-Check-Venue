# Coat Check - Venue

This is a **proof of concept** application to be used by a large scale venue for efficiently checking and
returning coat's that guests have checked in.

The system uses Firebase DB to store all relevant user and venue data, this allows the data to be 
fetched quickly whenever required by the venue or the user.

### Note:
Realtime Firebase DB data are stored as JSON objects. To ensure data security and integrity, each venue is given a unique user ID,
this allows for each venue to quickly access their relevant data and keeps the data of other venues private and inaccessible.

## **Overall Structure of the Firebase DB:**
### Venue
A **Venue** JSON array stores the data of all venues registered with Coat Check. 
A venue is given a unique user id and their metadata is stored in their respective object. For readability, 
the venue objects are labelled venue1, venue2, etc... When in production, the venue objects will be referenced by their user ID.

### Coats
A seperate JSON array named **Coats** holds the coat room data for each venue. This data is a stores the username of the guest who's coat is 
hung on a specific hanger. The hanger data can be either "Available" or store a username, "Available" indicates the hanger is not in use.

### Users
A seperate JSON array named **Users** stores an array of Venues and a single integer. In each Venue array is the User data of each 
checked coat. This data includes the coat owner's username, the hanger that their coat is hung on, their full name, email and phone number.
This data is used to quickly retrieve the owner's coat, or to help the venue contact the user if there is any issue with their coat.
The single integer in the **Users** parent array stores the total number of users with checked coats.

## **How it works:**
A companion application is required, it will simply ask for a user to register an account using Google or Facebook, the companion application
will store the user's personal information like their phone number and email. When the user arrives at the venue they simply have to
press a button on their app that says "Check Coat", the app will generate a QR Code and then the coat check attendant at the venue will
scan the QR Code using this Coat-Check-Venue application. The user companion app will store the coat hanger data for their coat, and the 
venue application will push the data to the Firebase DB.

When the user returns to retrieve their coat, the user will show the QR code generated by their companion app to the coat check attendant,
the attendant then scans the QR code with the Coat-Check-Venue application and their coat data will be retrieved from the Firebase DB.
Once the attendant has verified the coat has been returned, the user's data will be removed from the Firebase DB and their hanger will be
marked available.
